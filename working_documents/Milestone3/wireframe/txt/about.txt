Code Fair Goals

CODE FAIR 2017 WILL BE HELD ON FRIDAY NOVEMBER 10, 2017. 

Currently Charles Darwin University has five VET courses in IT; seven undergraduate courses and 2 post graduate IT courses. At least 60% of students who enroll in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses are International, with English as a second language, they are male and between the ages of 19 – 35.  There are approximately 180 UG students in the program and 50 Masters students.

The code fair provides a means to encourage and support students’ coding development showcasing their work more broadly to the University and industry communities. To celebrate the international hour of code is also part of the goals to promote coding throughout the educational community so the Code Fair reaches out to the secondary school community with code hour workshops. A final aspect of the code fair is to help all IT students meet local businesses with a view to facilitate future employment pathways.
