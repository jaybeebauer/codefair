Employer Speed Dating (2016)
Once again, as this was the third year of employer speed dating, the process and concept had matured and the event flowed smoothly with the timing working well. All students who were part of the speed dating had attended a preparation event and this was evident. The two categories were also useful and saw a number of new industry involvement as a result.
Ideas for further refinement of this process include:
•	Encourage students to do more preparation for this event by looking up the businesses involved and finding out what they do
•	Based on this information then tailor their message to that specific business.
•	Students need to ‘sell themselves’: how can they help the particular business they are meeting.
•	Students need to be able to communicate what ‘value’ they bring to the business.
•	Employers are looking for digital evidence: URL to a portfolio or GitHub site.
•	The time of the speed dating is short: consider leaving people with customized digital resumes.
