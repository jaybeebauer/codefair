Code Fair Events

Code Fair 2016 included six major activities:
---------------------
1. Business Innovation Challenge
A new initiative, a Business Innovation Challenge, was introduced as a lead up event to 2016 Code Fair. Launched 6 weeks out from the Code Fair (just before end of semester assessment period!) this challenge, provided by the NT government, presented a real-life problem to students regarding how to communicate NT Road conditions using 21st century technologies. 7 students (1 team and 3 individuals) participated in the competition and the industry judges and academic staffs were highly impressed with the level of innovation all students displayed.  Students had to create a prototype and or concept for solving the problem and then communicate this through a 5 minute presentation.  Beside a monetary prize, the NT government have employed 5 students during summer as part of a development think tank so that their ideas can be turned into reality.

2. Coding competitions
The competition was open to all IT students (VET, and Higher Education) who had created apps; programs; mobile prototypes, websites, games that demonstrate their developing knowledge, skills in building elegant, maintainable code that works.   9 students submitted 9 examples of their works as individuals and 18 students submitted 7 examples of their works as 7 groups. Students were judged by a panel of industry judges in various categories associated with their level of study: novice, intermediate and advanced as individuals or groups. There was also an overall innovation prize awarded. One judge who has been part of the Code Fair since its inception noted that there was a much higher standard than last year. I think the projects were well presented and there was some very clever work in there. Prize winners are listed opposite.

Judging the software
Judging the software in this event was very efficient: many judges had been involved for three years. This experience has now led to some more fine tuning of the process.  there were a number recommendations made to refine the judging processes. These include:
•	The judging matrix and criteria work well but there is no need for the numeric values
•	Consider different criteria for the innovation award
•	Clarify what is being judged: the code or the product
•	Judging code on small laptop screens can be difficult
•	Provide opportunities for judges to provide feedback to students when the prizes are being announced so that all students benefit more from this feedback.
•	As well as the sponsors presenting the prizes, build in time for the judges of each category to provide some general information to students
•	Consider giving certificates of participation to all students as well as the students who have received prizes
•	Ensure that there is space to hear what the students are pitching
•	Make sure all students know how to ‘pitch’ their software.
•	Only give prizes where the standard is high enough
•	Video the conversations around judging to show students

3. Poster competition
The poster competition was introduced in 2015 to encourage students whose IT pathways to a future career was in the more analytical aspects of the profession. The poster competition aims to encourage students to communicate their IT work and develop and expand their visual communication skills. In 2016, 12 students submitted 14 examples of their work.

4. Code Hour Workshops
Supporting the global ‘Hour of Code’ initiative to develop coding literacies, four x one hour (4 x 1 hour) workshops were run for 45 students from 3 local high schools (Casuarina Senior College, Darwin High School and Essington) and university staff.  Students from Casuarina Secondary School spent the day at the code fair participating in many of the events on the day while 20 university staff attended the Coding workshop which was very popular.
A big thank you to our Code Workshop facilitators: Rebecca England; Bidhan Neupane and Ali Farzand.  Bidhan and Ali this year are newly graduated CDU alumni who enjoyed the code fair so much they volunteered to come back and work with students to share their love of IT.

5. Industry Employer Speed Dating
Employer Speed provides graduating students an opportunity to meet local employers. This year there were two speed dating categories for students to enter: developer;  and IT support and networking. 18 students took up the opportunity (13 Masters students & 5 UG students).  Four new employers joined the 2016 Speed Dating  and the timing for the ‘speed dating’ includes 1 minute for the student to make a pitch to a prospective employer and 2 minutes for the employer to ‘interview’ the students. Students are only allowed to participate in the speed dating if they have attended a preparation session which looks at aspects of: appropriate dress; body language; oral presentation skills and CV preparations.  Students are giving an opportunity to trial their 1 minute pitch with all students asked to give feedback on how to make it better.

 - Employer Speed Dating
Once again, as this was the third year of employer speed dating, the process and concept had matured and the event flowed smoothly with the timing working well. All students who were part of the speed dating had attended a preparation event and this was evident. The two categories were also useful and saw a number of new industry involvement as a result.
Ideas for further refinement of this process include:
•	Encourage students to do more preparation for this event by looking up the businesses involved and finding out what they do
•	Based on this information then tailor their message to that specific business.
•	Students need to ‘sell themselves’: how can they help the particular business they are meeting.
•	Students need to be able to communicate what ‘value’ they bring to the business.
•	Employers are looking for digital evidence: URL to a portfolio or GitHub site.
•	The time of the speed dating is short: consider leaving people with customized digital resumes.

6. Academic Excellence awards
To encourage a greater emphasis on academic endeavours, this year a new category was introduced to recognise students who achieve highly in each subject taught in IT. Students who receive this award earn the highest scores in each unit.  This initiative enabled the university to also reach out to our off campus students and two students were flown to Darwin courtesy of sponsorship from DCIS.  9 students were recognise for their academic endeavours and they are listed above.
