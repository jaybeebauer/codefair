        <p>
          Currently Charles Darwin University has five VET courses in IT; seven undergraduate courses and 2 post graduate IT courses. At least 60% of students who enroll in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses are International, with English as a second language, they are male and between the ages of 19 – 35.  There are approximately 180 UG students in the program and 50 Masters students.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code fair provides a means to encourage and support students’ coding development showcasing their work more broadly to the University and industry communities. To celebrate the international hour of code is also part of the goals to promote coding throughout the educational community so the Code Fair reaches out to the secondary school community with code hour workshops. A final aspect of the code fair is to help all IT students meet local businesses with a view to facilitate future employment pathways.

                <p>
                  A new initiative, a Business Innovation Challenge, was introduced as a lead up event to 2016 Code Fair. Launched 6 weeks out from the Code Fair (just before end of semester assessment period!) this challenge, provided by the NT government, presented a real-life problem to students regarding how to communicate NT Road conditions using 21st century technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  7 students (1 team and 3 individuals) participated in the competition and the industry judges and academic staffs were highly impressed with the level of innovation all students displayed.  Students had to create a prototype and or concept for solving the problem and then communicate this through a 5 minute presentation.  Beside a monetary prize, the NT government have employed 5 students during summer as part of a development think tank so that their ideas can be turned into reality.

                <h4>2. Coding competitions</h4>
                <p>
                  The competition was open to all IT students (VET, and Higher Education) who had created apps; programs; mobile prototypes, websites, games that demonstrate their developing knowledge, skills in building elegant, maintainable code that works.   9 students submitted 9 examples of their works as individuals and 18 students submitted 7 examples of their works as 7 groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Students were judged by a panel of industry judges in various categories associated with their level of study: novice, intermediate and advanced as individuals or groups. There was also an overall innovation prize awarded. One judge who has been part of the Code Fair since its inception noted that there was a much higher standard than last year.

        <p>
                  The poster competition was introduced in 2015 to encourage students whose IT pathways to a future career was in the more analytical aspects of the profession. The poster competition aims to encourage students to communicate their IT work and develop and expand their visual communication skills. In 2016, 12 students submitted 14 examples of their work.

            <p>

            Supporting the global ‘Hour of Code’ initiative to develop coding literacies, four x one hour (4 x 1 hour) workshops were run for 45 students from 3 local high schools (Casuarina Senior College, Darwin High School and Essington) and university staff.  Students from Casuarina Secondary School spent the day at the code fair participating in many of the events on the day while 20 university staff attended the Coding workshop which was very popular.

          <h4>5. Industry Employer Speed Dating</h4>
            <p>

            Employer Speed provides graduating students an opportunity to meet local employers. This year there were two speed dating categories for students to enter: developer;  and IT support and networking. 18 students took up the opportunity (13 Masters students &amp; 5 UG students).
          </p>
          <p> Four new employers joined the 2016 Speed Dating  and the timing for the ‘speed dating’ includes 1 minute for the student to make a pitch to a prospective employer and 2 minutes for the employer to ‘interview’ the students. Students are only allowed to participate in the speed dating if they have attended a preparation session which looks at aspects of: appropriate dress; body language; oral presentation skills and CV preparations.  Students are giving an opportunity to trial their 1 minute pitch with all students asked to give feedback on how to make it better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last year, the following industry members took part in Speed Dating:
            <ul>
              <li>Captovate</li>

            <h4>6. Academic Excellence awards</h4>

            <p>
                To encourage a greater emphasis on academic endeavours, this year a new category was introduced to recognise students who achieve highly in each subject taught in IT. Students who receive this award earn the highest scores in each unit.  This initiative enabled the university to also reach out to our off campus students and two students were flown to Darwin courtesy of sponsorship from DCIS.

                Tips for Meeting Potential Employers

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Students are encouraged to do more preparation for this event by looking up the businesses involved and finding out what they do.</li>
              <li>Based on this information then tailor their message to that specific business.</li>
              <li>Students need to ‘sell themselves’: how can they help the particular business they are meeting.</li>
              <li>Students need to be able to communicate what ‘value’ they bring to the business.</li>
              <li>Employers are looking for digital evidence: URL to a portfolio or GitHub site.</li>
              <li>The time of the speed dating is short: consider leaving people with customized digital resumes.</li>
